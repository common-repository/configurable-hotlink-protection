This plugin modifies the site's .htaccess file and requires mod_rewrite or compatible modules like [ISAPI_rewrite for IIS](http://www.helicontech.com/isapi_rewrite/).

= Notes =
This plugin was inspired by the [Hotlink Protection](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-image-hotlink-protection/) plugin. There was a need for a more flexible implementation and so this plugin was created.

1. Unzip `configurable-hotlink-protection.zip` and upload the contents into the `/wp-content/plugins` directory
